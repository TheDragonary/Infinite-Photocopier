# Infinite Photocopier
Funny Python program that infinitely makes copies of an image

Be careful with running this script because it can make thousands of copies in seconds before you close it.

You can change the image to whatever you want, all you have to do is edit `main.py` and change the file name and/or file extension.

I would be extremely careful with the exe file :smirk:

I don't care what you do with this, go, have fun, troll someone or whatever.
